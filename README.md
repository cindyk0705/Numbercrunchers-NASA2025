Team Numbercrunchers for NASA Space Apps


## To Run Locally:
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``<br>
``
cd astroscope
``<br>
``
python3 app.py
``

## Note on Deployment:
- Since this is flask integrated: we will need an external hosting site.
- Chatgpt recommends render.com: there are others to checkout
- Flask WSGI is not suitable for production environments: check chat for solution
